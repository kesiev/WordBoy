A WordBoy is a GameBoy-shaped grid of letters...

<div align="center" style="margin:60px 0">

</div>

...and up to 4 cartriges, with a hint and a black and white grid...

<div align="center" style="margin:60px 0">
    <p><img src="photos/carts.png"></p>
</div>

The hidden message of each cartrige can be read folding the cartrige, plugging it into the right WordBoy and reading it against the light.

The trick is: you can shuffle/hide multiple cartiges and WordBoys, requiring some teamwork and interaction between people in order to solve the puzzles

## Setup

Download this repository and serve the folder with the web server you like. You can customize a lot of stuff from the core file `wordboy.js` and the frontend `index.html`. If you feel creative you can even customize the WordBoy and cartrige layout, modifying the `wordboy.svg` file - I've used the excellent [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

## Fonts

I've used the [Early GameBoy](https://www.dafont.com/early-gameboy.font) for the grid and the hints but you can change it the way you like.

## History

I've coded this program and used WordBoys puzzle in my wedding with Bianca for a short and light escape room game at the restaurant... In which me and my wife were dressed like fictional Japanese madmen - based on the crazy drawings of our nephews.

Our purpose was to let all the families interact together. It worked pretty well!
